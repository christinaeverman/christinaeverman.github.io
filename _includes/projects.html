    <p>For my computer science capstone project at ASU, I developed an Android app to teach English to students in Japan. I worked with a group of three other computer science students and a sponsor working for the Gunma Prefectural Board of Education in Japan. Our app was designed to be an educational game that utilizes speech recognition software to recognize correct pronunciation of English vocabulary words. The player plays as Gunma-chan, Gunma Prefecture's official mascot, who walks along the screen encountering enemies. The player must pronounce the English word displayed on the screen correctly before running into the enemy that approaches Gunma-chan. A correct pronunciation means the player defeats the enemy and their score increases, but an incorrect pronunciation means the player loses a life. There are levels of increasing difficulty, and to win the game the player must pronounce all words correctly without losing all their lives. There are also mini games that can be played to learn new English vocabulary words in preparation for the main game.</p>

    </ul>
    <p>Collaborating with a group of one other developer and two artists for my game development certificate program capstone project at ASU, I created an educational game to teach basic psychology to high school students at ASU Prep Digital. The goal was to teach the students about the different branches of psychology taught in the first unit of their psychology course. The game is essentially a series of escape room games. The player begins in the hub room, and can choose from five different doors to enter. Behind each door is a room that represents a different psychologist's office, and each of the psychologists are associated with a different branch of psychology. When the player enters one of the five doors, they must find four clues that demonstrate the branch of psychology present in that office. The four clues are objects that can be found around the room. The player can walk around and look in any direction for a clue, and when a clue is within their view, it will be highlighted and a description of the clue is displayed. Once all four clues are found, the player can "escape" the room and return to the hub. After the player successfully "escapes" all five rooms, a final test is presented in the hub. The test consists of a drag and drop system in which the the player drags a card with the room number to the branch of psychology they think it matches. The player wins once they match all five rooms to the correct branches of psychology.</p>

    <p>In my game engine development class at ASU, I created a game engine from scratch and utilized it in my final project to create a 3D puzzle game called Color Tiles. In each level, the player is provided with a grid with different white and orange tiles, and a picture of what the final grid should look like. The player moves a block forward, right, left, or backward on the grid and every time the block moves to a different tile, that tile's color is changed. In more advanced levels, there are also other blocks that the player must push with the main block to match the positions in the picture. </p>

    </h3>

    </ul>
    <p>I took a study abroad class in Tokyo, for which I created a simulation of foot traffic in a seven-story arcade in Tokyo and used it to determine the best arcade game layout to maximize profits. I used three different types of arcade games: crane games lasting one minute in length, rhythm games lasting three minutes in length, and simulation games lasting five minutes in length. Since the arcade contains seven floors, I determined six different possible layouts in which crane games are on three floors, rhythm games are on two floors, and simulation games are on two floors. For example, one layout is the bottom three floors are crane games, the middle two floors are simulation games, and the top two floors are rhythm games. The user can choose between the six different layouts and run the simulation, and the results page will display the total profit at the end of the simulation. During the simulation, customers will spawn and take either the elevator or the stairs to a random floor, and play a random arcade game. Each customer spends about ten minutes in the arcade playing random games and traveling to random floors and then leaves the arcade. The user can compare the results pages from all six different layouts to determine which layout is optimal for the best profits. I found that the ideal layout is the bottom three floors are crane games, the middle two floors are rhythm games, and the top two floors are simulation games.</p>
